# Asthma_Disease_data_Analysis
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Asthma Disease Dataset. This dataset contains extensive health information for 2,392 patients diagnosed with Asthma Disease, uniquely identified with IDs ranging from 5034 to 7425. It includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, environmental and allergy factors, medical history, clinical measurements, symptoms, and a diagnosis indicator. This dataset is valuable for researchers and data scientists aiming to explore factors associated with Asthma, develop predictive models, and conduct statistical analyses.

# Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

# Tools Used 
* Google Colab

# Dataset Exploration and Cleaning 
*  The dataset is imported into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
*  Initial data exploration includes examining the data frame's structure, dimensions, and columns, renaming some names, and dropping the irrelevant ones.
*  Null values in the dataset are identified and addressed, ensuring data integrity.
*  The data types of specific columns are modified to facilitate analysis.
